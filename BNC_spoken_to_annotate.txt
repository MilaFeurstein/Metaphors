KCE 97511	Mm .
KCE 97512	And erm and then like , he went #back #in #after we 'd finished playing and me and Scott #carried #on playing #for a bit and then erm what was he #going ?
KCE 97513	Oh yeah , he told me afterwards right , that he , the only reason he was angry was because Friday night reminded him of the time #in his past or something !
KCE 97514	And Pete reminded him of , him of the person that he hated and all this !
KCE 97515	And I was thinking Shrimpy , you 're stupid !
KCE 97516	#Get a #life !
KCE 97517	You sure !
KCE 97518	Oh !
KCE 97519	And then , cos I thought boy !
KCE 97520	So what did he do ?
KCE 97521	What did Shrimpy do #on Friday night ?
KCE 97522	Oh , he told Richard Richard that he was , he was gon na se , he wanted to #smack Pete 's face in !
KCE 97523	Oh yeah !
KCE 97524	So what did Richard do ?
KCE 97525	#Course , Richard who #keeps everything #to himself !
KCE 97526	Richard not known as Mersey #Tunnel Gob or anything !
KCE 97527	Oh dear !
KCE 97528	Oh dear I could n't believe it though !
KCE 97529	I mean that is sad !
KCE 97530	Ahhh no !
KCE 97531	I ca n't believe it !
KCE 97532	But Pete #reckoned it was because like cos like Pete 's #seeing Susan
KCE 97533	Mm .
KCE 97534	and like
KCE 97535	Then he was with you .
KCE 97536	and he was with me
KCE 97537	Yeah .
KCE 97538	and he #reckoned Pete was a total #bastard and everything !
KCE 97539	Even though he does n't know Susan he a
KCE 97540	Yeah .
KCE 97541	he reckons Pete 's #cheating #on Susan , he 's been really bad #to Helena as well he 's just #using them and all
KCE 97542	Yeah .
KCE 97543	this #business .
KCE 97544	But , #in a #way I mean like , I thought that as well , but then I thought well that 's stupid that is because you were n't as as bad as Pete was were you ?
KCE 97545	I mean , let 's #face it
KCE 97546	I mean , who 's #taking advantage of him
KCE 97547	You were ta , you were #taking advantage , not him !
KCE 97548	I mean , #on both times it 's been me #taking advantage of him , it really
KCE 97549	Yeah .
KCE 97550	because
KCE 97551	I mean he
KCE 97552	he 's been both times and I have n't .
KCE 97553	Let 's #face it you fancy him do n't you ?

KCE 97559	But like
KCE 97560	He 's so funny though !
KCE 97561	He #cracked me #up , he #goes like , like #with that I mean
KCE 97562	And Shrimpy fancies you #rotten anyway !
KCE 97563	That 's the only the reason !
KCE 97564	He 's probably just jealous !
KCE 97565	Well like I said , I said that , I said that to Pete and Pete #goes , God I wish he 'd #make #up his #mind !
KCE 97566	Yeah .
KCE 97567	So he 'd obviously sa not said it , I mean Pete was really shocked !

KCE 97572	so I dunno !
KCE 97573	He said it #to Andy though , and I mean I do n't , I do n't know , Andy really surprises me because like he always seems to be like , the #quiet one does n't it ?
KCE 97574	I mean , when we 're all like , laughing and joking and everything he 's like , oh yeah really #in #with it but when everyone 's like arguing or whatever he he
KCE 97575	Mm .
KCE 97576	does n't get involved because everything revolves #round him does n't it ?

KCE 97584	But like , I do n't mind cos I know he wo n't say anything .
KCE 97585	Mm .
